Hello, I am Tobest, a web developer from Nigeria, so happy to work with aeternity blockchain so as to solve problems.
I was able to develop an aepp that allows writers publish their articles on the blockchain and when people read 
such article and falls in love with it could easily appreciate the author with any amount of aettos token as he/she likes. 
Its meant to help authors find a place to earn from writing quality articles. All an author has to do is fill in the title, 
his name, the article and a few lines of caption in the form field.
Articles with the highest appreciation appear on top as it would catch more peoples attention due to its value.


## Issues I Rectified
* Error: You need to deploy contract before calling!  and Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'decode' of undefined
    * I fixed it by redeploying your contract and assigning a new contract address ct_FFoNXy4yapxpfqgvuXtW33hrvMtmhv9BUX3rHSP3km5jet1dm
    * Also reordered your functions
* Mustace Template not displaying article informations
    * fixed that also in your index.js
